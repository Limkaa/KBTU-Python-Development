In this final project, I needed to create, using the Python programming language, an online tank game with several modes:

1. Offline for two players
2. Online (with other players)
3. Online (artificial intelligence).

Students were provided with a common server with a configured RabbitMQ queue and process processing logic. The task of each participant is to competently implement all game modes, set up a connection to a common server and process incoming data from it.
